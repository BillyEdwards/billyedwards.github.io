##Twinkle

As the Project Scientist of the Twinkle Space Mission I lead studies into the capability of the satellite to conduct visible and infrared spectroscopy of transiting exoplanets and of the small bodies of our Solar System. I am responsible for understanding how design changes could affect the performance, aiming to ensure the optimal design is chosen.
