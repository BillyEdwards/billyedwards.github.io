## Twinkle

As the Project Scientist of the Twinkle Space Mission I lead studies into the capability of the satellite to conduct visible and infrared spectroscopy of transiting exoplanets and of the small bodies of our Solar System. Over a three year survey, Twinkle will characterise the atmospheres of around 100 exoplanets while also studying the surface composition of thousands of asteroids. I have been leading studies into the potential uses of the Twinkle mission. Find out more [here](https://www.twinkle-spacemission.co.uk).

## Ariel

Ariel, the ESA M4 mission which will launch in 2029, will characterise the atmospheres of ~1000 exoplanets with instruments providing simultaneous spectral coverage from 0.5-7.8 microns. By studying a large and diverse population of exoplanetary atmospheres, Ariel will offer profound insights into planetary formation and evolution within our galaxy. I work on understanding the performance of Ariel's instrumentation, analysing the potential planets we could observe with the mission and exploring methodologies of maximising the scientific yield. See the Ariel [website](https://arielmission.space) for further details.

## ORBYTS and ExoClock

As part of the Originial Research By Young Twinkle Students (ORBYTS) programme, secondary school pupils (16/17 years old) are taught university-level astrophysics by PhD students or early career researchers. The goal of every partnership is that school students will have the opportunity to use this new knowledge to contribute towards publishable research. Pupils get hands on experience of scientific research and work closely with young scientists. By partnering schools with relatable researchers, the programme aims to not only improve student aspirations and scientific literacy, but also help to address diversity challenges by dispelling harmful stereotypes, challenging any preconceptions about who can become a scientist. The organisers and tutors strongly believe that all school students should have the opportunity to become involved in active scientific research and to be culturally connected to space missions.

The programme I run offers school pupils the chance to enrich our understanding of exoplanets by improving our knowledge their orbits and their physical properties by observing the worlds when they transit their host star. This provides a unique opportunity for pupils to undertake cutting-edge science that has a meaningful impact on a future space mission. The students plan, acquire, reduce and analyse the observations and the last two cohorts of students have been co-authors on a publication due to their impressive contributions to the research. In connection with this, I am the Principal Investigator of an accepted proposal for telescope time on the Las Cumbres Observatory as part of the LCO Global Sky Partners.

The data taken as part of the ORBYTS programme has also contributed to a wider citizen science effort. The ExoClock scheme engages with telescope owners or users around the world with the aim of ensuring the ephemerides of exoplanets that are suitable for atmospheric characterisation with Ariel are kept up-to-date. All observers are welcome and you can join the project [here](https://exoclock.space).
