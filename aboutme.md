I'm a postdoctoral research at University College London (UCL),  a Research Associate on the ESA Ariel mission and the Project Scientist of the [Twinkle Space Mission](www.twinkle-spacemission.co.uk). My work is largely focused on modelling the performance of upcoming space-based telescopes for exoplanet atmospheric characterisation. 

I also work on the analysis of data from the Hubble Space Telescope and am involved with outreach schemes which aim to refine the ephemerides of exoplanets so their transit times are well-known for future atmospheric studies.
