subtitle: Hello! I'm a postdoctoral research at University College London (UCL) as well as the project scientist of the Twinkle Space Mission. I'm also a Research Associate on the ESA Ariel mission and my work is largely focused on modelling the performance of upcoming space-based telescopes for exoplanet atmospheric characterisation. I dabble in the analysis of data from the Hubble Space Telescope and am involved with outreach schemes which aim to refine the ephemerides of exoplanets so their transit times are well-known for future atmospheric studies.
